## Introduction ##
We are living in a fast-paced world. Nobody has time to absorb all the information that is thrown at us on a daily basis. With Internet being an endless source of text data, it is humanly impossible to keep pace. Such volume of data represents an invaluable source of knowledge which needs to be effectively summarized to be useful. GIST solves this problem by instantly truncating and filtering out any unnecessary data from any given website. Simply enter the url of your choice and let GIST get to the gist of it at a click of a button!

## What is text summarization? ##
Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source document to produce a coherent and fluent summary, without loosing the overall meaning. The intention is to transform lengthy documents into shortened versions.

## Why do we need AI text summarization? ##
* Time optimization - it takes considerably less time to get the gist of the text in a summary
* Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers
* When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier
