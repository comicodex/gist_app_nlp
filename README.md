## Introduction ##
We are living in a fast-paced world. Nobody has time to absorb all the information that is thrown at us on a daily basis. GIST solves this problem by instantly truncating and filtering out any unnecessary data from any given website. Simply enter the url of your choice and let GIST get to the gist of it at a click of a button!

## About ##
A fully responsive web application that scrapes the data from any given website and produces a coherent and fluent summary distilling key information while maintaining the overall meaning.
